+ send in patches for 8bit and 16bit bus formats for adv7175
+ extend adv7175 driver to support different bus formats
+ make use of adv7175 bus formats in em8300 driver (ADV717X_PIXELPORT_16BIT)
+ find a way to integrate pixel data adjustment in adv7175 driver
  HSYNC to Pixel Data Adjust
  these bits adjust the VSYNC pulsewidth.
  This enables the HSYNC to be adjusted with respect to the
  pixel data. This allows the Cr and Cb components to be
  swapped. This adjustment is available in both master and slave
  timing modes.

+ make use of videobuf2
+ is there a way to do a/v sync directly in the driver?
+ cleanup/add needed locking
+ check all error paths for resource leaks
+ work on own decoding api for v4l2 or use DVB api
+ how to integrate SPU?

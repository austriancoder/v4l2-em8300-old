Git repo to clean up em8300 driver.

- remove old 2.6 kernel stuff
--> will only compile with recent 2.6 kernel

- use kernles encoders for adv7xx and bt865
-- we need to extend current adv7175 and adv7170 drivers
   to support media-bus.
-- add bt865 driver to mainline kernel

- convert to use v4l2 interface

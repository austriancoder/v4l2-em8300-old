General fixes:

 em8300:
   activate_loopback   -- set to 1 if you lose video signal
                          when uploading the microcode
   bt865_ucode_timeout -- set to 1 if you have a bt865 and get timeouts
                          when uploading the microcode.
   alsa_id             -- set the ID string for ALSA audio.
   alsa_index          -- set the index value for ALSA audio.
   dsp_num             -- set the /dev/dsp number to assign to the card for OSS
                          audio. -1 for automatic (this is the default). If
                          em8300 is being loaded before your sound card module
                          you can use this to force em8300 to use a more
                          sensible dsp number.
   stop_video          -- set to 1 if you want to stop video output instead of
                          outputting black when there's nothing to display

 bt865:
   output_mode         -- select the output mode to use:
     comp+svideo       -- both svideo and composite video output
                          for use with the provided composite video adapter
                          or a svideo cable (default)
     rgb               -- separated rgb
                          for use with modified boards to get the required 4th
                            signal, for high quality video
   color_bars          -- set to 1 to enable color bars
                          (only used to test the chip)

 adv717x:
   output_mode         -- select the output mode to use:
     comp+svideo       -- both svideo and composite video output
                          for use with the provided composite video adapter
                          or a svideo cable (default)
     svideo            -- svideo only
     comp              -- composite video only
                          for use with the provided composite video adapter
     comp+psvideo      -- both svideo with luminance replaced by composite
                            video and composite
                          for use either with the provided composite video
                            adapter, or with ones that use svideo luma as
                            composite video, or as degraded svideo
                          (especially useful if you don't know what kind of
                            cabling you will use)
     psvideo           -- svideo with luminance replaced by composite video
                          for use with svideo to video composite adapter that
                            use svideo luma as composite video, or as degraded
                            svideo
     composvideo       -- composite svideo on the luminance pin of the svideo
                            connector
                          for use with svideo to composite video adapter that
                            use svideo luma as composite video
     yuv               -- separated yuv
                          for use with special-purpose cables, such as the ones
                            provided with Sigma Designs' Xcard boards, and with
                            high-end tv sets or video projectors
     rgb               -- separated rgb
                          for use with modified boards to get the required 4th
                            signal, for high quality video
     rgbs              -- separated rgb with sync on each signal
                          might be usable with no hardware modification of the
                            board, with high-end tv sets or video projectors
                            that support such signals
   color_bars          -- set to 1 to enable color bars
                          (only used to test the chip)


If your red and blue colors channels are switched:

 adv717x:
   pixeldata_adjust_ntsc -- If your red and blue colours are swapped in NTSC,
                            try setting this to 0,1,2 or 3. Defaults to 1.
   pixeldata_adjust_pal  -- If your red and blue colours are swapped in PAL,
                            try setting this to 0,1,2 or 3. Defaults to 1.


Greenscreen (tvout only) fixes:

 adv717x:
   pixelport_16bit     -- use 16bit pixelport control
   pixelport_other_pal -- use the opposite pixelport control for pal mode
                          if you only use/care about NTSC or PAL ignore this

 em8300:
   dicom_fix       -- set register 0x1f5e to 0x1efe instead of 0x1afe
   dicom_control   -- set dicom control register to 0x9efe instead of 0x9afe
   dicom_other_pal -- use the opposite fix values for pal mode
                      if you only use/care about NTSC or PAL ignore this.

Common settings to fix greenscreen:

adv717x pixelport_16bit=1 pixelport_other_pal=1
em8300  dicom_fix=1 dicom_control=1 dicom_other_pal=1

adv717x pixelport_16bit=0 pixelport_other_pal=0
em8300  dicom_fix=1 dicom_control=1 dicom_other_pal=0

adv717x pixelport_16bit=0 pixelport_other_pal=1
em8300  dicom_fix=1 dicom_control=1 dicom_other_pal=1

adv717x pixelport_16bit=1 pixelport_other_pal=0
em8300  dicom_fix=0 dicom_control=0 dicom_other_pal=0
